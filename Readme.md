# The Selfish Meme

This is the code I wrote to support the work I have been doing on my talk **The Selfish Meme**. I had been working on these ideas for the past year or so in various engagements and had always believed that I could formalise the work and codify it. This project is intended to support the work by demonstrating some simple simulations.
